# 📝 Notes 

Notes taken in LaTeX and Markdown for Stanford courses, self-learning, and everything else. I have organized these notes as follows: 

- `courses`: notes that follow along courses I have taken at Stanford. 
- `individual`: notes that do not belong to any overarching class. 
- `src`: if the notes were typeset in LaTeX, the source will be stored here. 

Note that some notes are formatted using HTML and are thus not visible directly within the Github repository. Please visit to the static site linked [here](https://rosikand.github.io/notes) to access these notes and all of the other notes. 

The files/directories `index.html`, `css`, `images` are for the [website](https://rosikand.github.io/notes) source.
